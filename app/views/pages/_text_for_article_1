<h3>'Hi. We’re a green business.<br>
Here’s our huge paper catalog.'</h3>

<p>Ok, we don’t offer the paper version of our entire product list up that fast. Some people do actually want to buy from us immediately just because of our company mission and all the perks.  But most companies are resistant to change and require a little more work.</p>
<p>So we print paper catalogs, and we think it’s an important thing to do.</p>
<p>Here’s exactly why…</p>
<h3>Reason #1: The Sheer Mass of Products</h3>
<p>We often introduce ourselves as a new, innovative, green, charitable company.  While that’s true, it can create a false impression of our product offering – that it’s small.</p>
<p>It’s not.</p>
<p>We actually sell over 48,000 business products; including furniture, breakroom supplies, janitorial supplies, AND traditional office supplies.  That number is always growing, and we’re going for the ‘endless ailsle’ just like some older companies are.</p>
<p>Holding a printed summary of what's in that huge warehouse make it so much easier for a new customer to understand that, and to feel at ease.</p>
<p>When customers feel at ease and taken care of, something beautiful happens:</p>
<p><b>Loyalty in business becomes sustainable.</b></p>
<h3>Reason #2: Catalogs take up physical space in your office. </h3>
<p>The Socialwise catalog is a big book. It weighs about 7 pounds. It’s a little heavy to carry around. So after we give it to you, you’re going to have to do something with it.</p>
<p>You can do the following things with our catalog:</p>
<ol>
    <li>throw it away</li>
     <li>file it away</li>
     <li>stare at it on your desk</li>
     <li>sit on it</li>
     <li>stand on it to better reach the top shelf</li>
     <li>call attention to yourself by throwing it at the wall when life gets hard</li>
     <li>use it to buy stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course we prefer the latter, but really any of the above would be fine.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>We just want to remind you of Socialwise without being annoying. This is so important.  We want you to become part of the community of companies who partner with us.  <b>Many of our customers are also working to use business as a force for good, and it’s good for us to know each other.</b> Seeing our catalog on a shelf reminds you of that community, and maybe you’ll be even more inspired to do something great.</p>
<h3>Reason #3: It’s like we brought you a little gift.</h3>

<p>If I am your account rep, and I come into your office for the purpose of giving you something (the catalog) that shows you how to save your company money AND do cool things like donate to charitable causes, you’ll probably feel more connected to us as a community of innovative companies than if I just send you an email with a link to our website.</p>
<p>You’ll see that as your rep, I care about making sure you know your options. You’ll see that I take time out to meet with you as a person.  I’ll answer any questions you have on the spot, like right in front of you.</p>
<p><b>Like in the 90’s, when people talked to each other.</b></p>
<h3>In the end, we believe that printing catalogs and selling to great clients is more green than not doing business.</h3>

<p>This isn’t just about us wanting more customers – this is about providing an option for a consumer that sells the products they need at a price they like, AND is doing social good.  </p>
<strong class="green"><p> When you buy from Socialwise, you know that</p>
<ul> 
<li>you’re helping give to charity (we give 100% of net profits* to charitable causes)</li>
<li>you get good or better pricing on whatever you’re buying now (we price match)</li>
<li>you’re given options to switch to reasonably priced recycled products when possible</li>
<li>you have a personal rep working with you to make sure you are well taken care of</li>
<li>lots of other great perks that only our customers know about</li>
</ul>
